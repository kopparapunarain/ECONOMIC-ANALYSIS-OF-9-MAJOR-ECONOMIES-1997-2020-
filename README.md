# Comparative economic analysis of 9 major economies (1997–2020): correlations, regressions and crisis impacts on GDP, inflation, manufacturing and markets.

This project analyses 10 macroeconomic indicators for nine major economies (1997–2020) to explore relationships between manufacturing, GDP growth, inflation, trade balance and stock-market performance. Methods include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, linear regression and visualisation to assess the effects of the 2008 and 2020 crises. Key outputs highlight country-level differences in driver relationships and crisis impact.

Key findings:

Manufacturing output is strongly correlated with stock-market indices in the U.S. and India; weaker or negative correlations in several other economies.

Inflation and trade balance are generally not linearly related to GDP growth across countries; the U.S. shows a notable inflation–GDP relationship.

Crisis impact: India experienced the largest inflation shock (2008 & 2020), while Japan (2008) and Spain (2020) saw the largest stock-market declines.
