# Comparative Economic Analysis of 9 Major Economies (1997â€“2020)

This project presents an in-depth analysis of ten macroeconomic indicators across nine major economies from 1997 to 2020. The study investigates the interplay between manufacturing output, GDP growth, inflation, trade balance, and stock market performance, focusing on the effects of global crises.

## Key Insights

- **Manufacturing & Markets:** Manufacturing output strongly correlates with stock market indices in the U.S. and India, while several other countries exhibit weaker or negative relationships.
- **Inflation & GDP Growth:** Across most countries, inflation and trade balance have limited or inconsistent linear relationships with GDP growth. The U.S., however, stands out with a notable link between inflation and GDP.
- **Impact of Global Crises:** 
  - India experienced the sharpest inflation spikes during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic.
  - Japan (in 2008) and Spain (in 2020) suffered the most significant stock market declines among the studied nations.
